# Advent of Code 2021
This is my first Advent of Code. I wanted to learn a bit more about Python, that's why it is my language of choice this year.
## Restrictions
As I've always used Python exclusively for quick and dirty helper applications, I set myself the restriction that I don't declare any functions, except two for the two parts of each day in AoC. I also refrain from importing any packages, using only Python's builtin features.

So the code may look a little messy with many things being e.g. copy-pasted, but that's the spirit of Python (for me at least)!
